        <h2 class="story">The story</h2>
        <p class="first paragraph">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.</p></header>
<article>
    <p That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,<q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
    The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>maybe</em></q>
    The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and
    said,
    <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
    The farmer again said,<q class="farmer"><em>maybe</em></q>
    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
    leg.
    The neighbors then said,<q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too
    <tag class="bad">bad</tag>
</q>, and the farmer responded,<q class="farmer"><em>maybe</em></q>
    The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
    and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and
    said,<q class="villagers">Isn’t that great! </q>
    Again, he said,<q class="farmer"><em>maybe</em></q>
    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
    and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is
    <tag class="good">good</tag>
    or
    <tag class="bad">bad</tag>
    —
    because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
    you never know what will be the consequences of
    <tag class="good">good</tag>
    fortune.</p>

<H4>Conclusion</H4>

<blockquote>
    <tag class="good">good</tag>
    and
    <tag class="bad">bad</tag>
    are just one perspective. Bananas are
    <tag class="good">good</tag>
    for monkeys, but monkeys are not
    <tag class="good">good</tag>
    for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...

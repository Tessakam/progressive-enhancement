    <h2>The story</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
            That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
            They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
            The farmer said, <em>“maybe”</em> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
            and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events.
            You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <em>“maybe”</em>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
            The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too bad</q>, and the farmer responded, <em>“maybe”</em>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
            and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and
            said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <em>“maybe”</em>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
            and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad —
            because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
            you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

<H4>Conclusion</H4>

<blockquote> <tag attribute="good">good</tag> and <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...

    <h2 class="story">The story</h2>
        <p class="first paragraph">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.</p>
            <p That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
            They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
            The farmer said,<q class="farmer"><em>maybe</em></q>
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
            <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
            The farmer again said,<q class="farmer"><em>maybe</em></q>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
            The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <tag class="bad">bad</tag></q>, and the farmer responded,<q class="farmer"><em>maybe</em></q>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
            and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and
            said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great! </q>
            Again, he said,<q class="farmer"><em>maybe</em></q>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
            and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <tag class="good">good</tag> or <tag class="bad">bad</tag> —
            because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
            you never know what will be the consequences of <tag class="good">good</tag> fortune.</p>

<H4>Conclusion</H4>

<blockquote> <tag class="good">good</tag> and <tag class="bad">bad</tag> are just one perspective. Bananas are <tag class="good">good</tag> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <tag class="good">good</tag> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
